These cookies do not collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website works. This helps us understand user behavior patterns, identify popular content, and optimize site performance to enhance your browsing experience.

For instance, remembering your preferred recipe filters or language settings. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts, and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They enhance user convenience by tailoring the site to your preferences.

They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operatorâ€™s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. This allows for more personalized ad experiences.

These cookies are typically used to enable core functionalities of the site, such as maintaining your login session, remembering your preferences, or collecting anonymous analytics data directly for our use. They are essential for a smooth and personalized experience on our platform, ensuring that your interactions are remembered across visits.

This happens when the website you are visiting incorporates elements from other sites, such as images, social media plugins, or advertising content. These cookies are often used for cross-site tracking, advertising, and analytics by external service providers. We carefully select our third-party partners to ensure they adhere to privacy standards.

                        Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser only until you leave the site. They are used to allow website operators to link your actions during a browser session. For example, they might remember items you've added to a shopping cart as you navigate different pages. Once you close your browser, these cookies are deleted, ensuring no long-term tracking of your single browsing session.

They are activated each time you visit the website that created that particular cookie. These cookies are used for various purposes, such as remembering your preferences for future visits, maintaining your login state, or tracking your behavior over time for analytics and advertising.

You can typically configure your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also block all cookies or delete existing cookies. Please note that blocking all cookies may impact the functionality of many websites, including DishRedo, potentially limiting your access to certain features.

                        Upon your first visit to DishRedo, you will encounter a cookie consent banner that provides you with options to accept or decline certain categories of cookies. This banner allows you to make an informed choice about the data collected through cookies. Your preferences will be saved, but you can always revisit your settings to change your mind. This mechanism ensures compliance with privacy regulations.

                        If you choose to decline certain cookies, especially functionality or targeting cookies, some features and functionalities of DishRedo may not work as intended. For example, personalized recommendations might be less accurate, or you might see less relevant advertisements. Declining strictly necessary cookies may even prevent the website from functioning correctly. We strive to provide a good experience regardless of your choices, but full functionality often relies on certain cookies.

                    <p>
                        In addition to cookies, we may use other similar technologies like web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels" or "clear GIFs"). These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages and emails. They help us understand user engagement and email effectiveness.

                    <p>
                        Beyond traditional cookies, modern web browsers offer other forms of local storage, such as HTML5 Web Storage (Local Storage and Session Storage). These allow websites to store larger amounts of data directly in the browser. Session Storage is temporary and cleared when the browser tab is closed, similar to session cookies. Local Storage is persistent and remains until manually cleared. We may use these for features like saving your progress on a recipe or remembering UI settings.

                    <p>
                        Cookies play a vital role in user authentication. When you log in to your DishRedo account, a cookie is set to remember your login session. This allows you to navigate through different pages of our website without having to re-enter your credentials repeatedly. These are typically session cookies that expire when you close your browser, or persistent cookies for "remember me" functionality, enhancing convenience and security.

                        Cookies are extensively used to personalize your experience on DishRedo. They remember your preferences, such as language settings, preferred units of measurement, or recently viewed recipes. This allows us to tailor the content and layout to your individual needs, making the website more intuitive and enjoyable for you. Personalization helps us deliver a more relevant and engaging culinary journey.

                        Certain cookies are used for security purposes, such as detecting and preventing fraudulent activities or unauthorized access to user accounts. They help us identify unusual login patterns or suspicious behavior, contributing to the overall security and integrity of our Services.

For example, if you use a "Share" button or log in via a social media account, the social media platform may set its own cookies to track your interaction. These cookies are governed by the privacy policies of the respective social media companies.

We provide general guidance, but for precise instructions, we recommend consulting the official help documentation for your specific browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

These settings allow you to clear browsing data, block third-party cookies, or manage site-specific permissions, giving you control over mobile tracking.

                        If you opt-out of cookies used for personalization, your experience on DishRedo may be less tailored to your interests. For example, recipe recommendations might be more generic, and content suggestions may not align as closely with your past browsing or saved preferences. This is a trade-off for increased privacy control.
